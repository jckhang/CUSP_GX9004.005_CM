    "Your task is to create a semi smart acquisition platform for urban sound data. This platform should log to file the time stamped RMS amplitude of its surrounding sound environment continuously at a time resolution of your choosing. It should also collect audio files, but only those with sufficient amplitude above the ambient amplitude. These audio files should be at least 1 second in length.\n",

    "You need to capture data over a 12 hour period, ideally from an outdoor environment to increase the variation in captured sound sources. These 12 hours should cover periods of high and low urban actvity, eg. rush hour and very early morning. If this is your only computer, an over night period may be best.\n",

    "   * If possible use an external microphone so that it can more easily pickup external sounds\n",
    "   * Make a number of test recordings of RMS data and audio to ensure the system is functional and collecting usable data before beginning the extended recording period\n",
